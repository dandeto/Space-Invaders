#Space Invaders HTML 5 Clone

###I am aiming to make this the most faithful online reproduction of the classic arcade game: Space Invaders.
I loved playing it at my local arcade, so I decided to build one in JavaScript as practice before I start to
make even bigger games.

I made all of the sprites by myself, but I looked at images of the game online so I could get them right.

I found the original sounds online somewhere a long time ago and haven't been able to find them since. I know some
other sites claim to have the original sfx released by Tiato, but they don't sound quite the same as I remember them being in
the arcade.
